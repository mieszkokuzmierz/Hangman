Hey! 

I'm Mieszko, 37 year old from Poland. I have a dream of becoming Python developer and to add to that dreaming I'm starting series of projects that will be available here. 

First one will be Hangman, so a fun word game where you need to guess random word by inputting the letters into the console. It's my learning so I will not be using any already existing solutions, but will try to develop and increase my own skills.

Let's see what the output will be!
